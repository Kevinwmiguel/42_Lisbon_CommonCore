# My 42 Projects

Welcome to my repository of projects completed during my time at [42 Lisboa](https://www.42lisboa.com/). Here you will find a collection of the projects I have completed, as well as details about my current progress.

## Completed Projects

### Libft
The **Libft** project involves creating a library of C functions that replicate various standard C library functions, as well as some additional functions that are commonly useful. This project was a great exercise in familiarizing myself with C and its functionalities.

### Printf
In the **Printf** project, I developed my own version of the C `printf` function. This project was an excellent way to gain a deeper understanding of string formatting at a low level and how to manage variable arguments.

### Get Next Line
The **Get Next Line** project involves creating a function that reads a line from a file descriptor one at a time. It is an essential project for understanding file handling and buffer management in C.

## Current Progress

### Push Swap
I am currently working on the **Push Swap** project. This project involves creating a program that sorts numbers using a limited set of operations on two stacks. It is a significant challenge in algorithm optimization and efficiency.
